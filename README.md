# P1_to_InfluxDB

To make sure that P1 is active you need to know what the IP is of P1 monitor.
I've used a static IP to make it easier and stable.

1:
Install InfluxDB on a device, I use a rpi 3 with booting from SSD.

2:
Make a bucket with the name P1monitor

2:
note your Organisation name and Token

3:
Change the organisation name and token

4:
Change the URL from to your own Influxdb server

5:
Change the ip adress of your P1 Homewizard.
